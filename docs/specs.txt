LOLCODE 1.2 specifications follow. The original spec can be found here
http://lolcode.com/specs/1.2#final-draft

1.) Start/end of the program:
    All LOLCODE programs must begin with HAI followed by the LOLCODE spec used
    (fatso will try to be 1.2 compatible)
    Similarly, the code should terminate with KTHXBYE

2.) Comments
    Single line comments in LOLCODE start with BTW
    Multiline comments are contained within OBTW and TLDR

3.) Variable Declarations
